This function ONLY SHOWS MY LOGIC. Since I do not have access to your classes or packages there was not much I could do so I made some assumptions about the existing code. I wrote the assumptions above my code as comments. I was going off just the idea you gave me here so obviously this is not concrete code; it is only showing logic!
